# Archived Documentation

This folder contains documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for historical reference.

## Why These Files Are Archived

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `cesm-porting.md` | CESM-specific installation - we now focus exclusively on CTSM |
| `cesm-usage.md` | CESM workflow documentation - CTSM has different workflows |
| `ctsm-doc-comparison.md` | Historical analysis of documentation discrepancies |
| `intro-to-earth-models.md` | Contained E3SM content and excessive CESM detail |

## Current Focus

This documentation now focuses on **CTSM (Community Terrestrial Systems Model)** running on HiPerGator at the University of Florida.

For current documentation, return to the [Home](../index.md) page.

## Notes

- CTSM is the land component of CESM, but can be run standalone
- We use a fork-based approach with HiPerGator-specific modifications
- Our fork: `github.com/cdevaneprugh/CTSM` branch `uf-ctsm5.3.085`
